# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

# split windows like vim
# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's
bind s split-window -v
bind v split-window -h

# move around panes with hjkl, as one would in vim after pressing ctrl-w
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
bind < resize-pane -L 1
bind > resize-pane -R 1
bind - resize-pane -D 1
bind + resize-pane -U 1

# bind : to command-prompt like vim
# this is the default in tmux already
bind : command-prompt

# vi-style controls for copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# window base index
set-option -g base-index 1

# use 256 colors by default

# disable the delay after esc key, to fix laggy mode switching in
# vim & kakoune etc.
set-option -g escape-time 0
